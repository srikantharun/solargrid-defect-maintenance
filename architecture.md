## Business Value

Solar farms represent significant investments that require optimal performance to maximize return. Even minor defects can substantially reduce energy production:

- A single defective panel can reduce string output by 20-30%
- Hotspots can lead to accelerated degradation and safety hazards
- Undetected moisture ingress can cause catastrophic failures
- Installation issues can remain hidden until significant damage occurs

This system provides:
- Early detection of defects before they cause significant production losses
- Prioritized maintenance schedules based on defect severity
- Reduced maintenance costs through targeted interventions
- Extended panel lifetime through early remediation
- Improved safety through continuous monitoring

## Defect Classification Methodology

Each detected defect is classified with:

1. **Defect Type**: Specific issue category
2. **Severity**: High, medium, or low impact
3. **Confidence Level**: AI certainty rating (0-1.0)
4. **Affected Area**: Location and extent of the defect
5. **Recommended Solution**: Suggested remediation steps
