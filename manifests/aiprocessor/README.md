# AI Processor for Solar Panel Defect Detection

The AI Processor module is responsible for analyzing sensor data to detect and classify defects in solar panels.

## Overview

This module uses a combination of rule-based analysis and machine learning techniques to identify various types of defects in solar panels based on data from multiple sensors:

- Temperature sensors
- Irradiance sensors 
- Humidity sensors
- Wind speed sensors
- Thermal imaging sensors

## Key Features

- Multi-sensor data fusion for comprehensive defect detection
- Thermal image analysis for hotspot detection
- Anomaly detection using isolation forests
- Integration with TensorFlow for deep learning models
- Real-time defect classification and severity assessment
- Defect tracking and trending over time

## Supported Defect Types

The AI processor can detect and classify the following types of defects:

### Temperature-Related
- Hotspots
- Overheating
- Junction box failures
- Poor ventilation

### Irradiance-Related
- Dust/dirt accumulation
- Partial shading
- Panel degradation

### Physical Defects
- Cell cracks
- Bypass diode failures
- Delamination
- Potential-induced degradation (PID)

### Environmental
- Moisture ingress
- High humidity exposure
- Wind stress and mounting issues

## Model Training

The AI processor can load pre-trained models from persistent storage. In a production environment, these models would be trained on historical data. The system currently supports:

1. **Isolation Forest** for anomaly detection
2. **TensorFlow models** for thermal image analysis

## API Endpoints

The AI Processor exposes several API endpoints:

- `/panel/{panel_id}/defects` - Get all detected defects for a specific panel
- `/panel/{panel_id}/analysis` - Trigger analysis for a specific panel
- `/panels/status` - Get status of all analyzed panels
- `/defects/summary` - Get a summary of all defects across panels

## Integration

The AI Processor is integrated with:

- Data Collector for retrieving sensor data
- Redis for caching processing results
- Kafka for real-time event processing (optional)
- API Server for exposing results to external systems

## Deployment

The AI processor is deployed as a Kubernetes pod with the following specifications:

- TensorFlow-enabled container
- Access to persistent storage for ML models
- Higher resource allocation (CPU/RAM) for processing
- Background processing threads for continuous analysis

## Monitoring

The AI Processor's performance can be monitored using Prometheus and Grafana:

- Model prediction accuracy
- Processing latency
- Defect detection rates
- System resource utilization
