# Pre-training And Transfer Learning Workflow

I've created a Kubernetes Job definition for you that will handle the complete transfer learning workflow using the FLIR dataset. The job will:

1. Download and process the FLIR dataset:

- Download the FLIR thermal dataset
- Extract and organize the thermal images
- Preprocess the images for training


2. Train a model using transfer learning:

- Use MobileNetV2 as the base model (efficient for edge deployment)
- Adapt the model for solar panel defect detection
- Train with appropriate data augmentation techniques for thermal images


3. Quantize the model to 8-bit precision:

- Perform quantization-aware training
- Convert the model to 8-bit precision for efficiency
- Generate both a standard H5 model and a TFLite version


4. Save the model to your persistent volume:

- Store the quantized model as thermal_model.h5
- Save model metadata for reference



The job has appropriate resource requests for GPU acceleration, and it mounts the same persistent volume claim (ml-model-storage) that your AI processor uses, ensuring the model will be available to your system after training.

## Key Features of the Implementation:

- GPU Support: Configured to use NVIDIA GPUs for faster training
- Efficient Architecture: Uses MobileNetV2, which is well-suited for edge deployment
- 8-bit Quantization: Reduces model size while maintaining accuracy
- Solar Panel Focus: Adapts the general thermal detection capabilities to specific solar panel defect classes

## Usage:

Apply the Job to your Kubernetes cluster:
```
kubectl apply -f thermal-model-training-job.yaml
```

Monitor the job progress:
```
kubectl logs -f job/thermal-model-trainer -n solar-panel-detection
```

Once completed, the model will be available to AI processor at /models/thermal_model.h5

## Notes:

The node selector (accelerator: nvidia-gpu) may need to be adjusted based on specific cluster configuration.
We may need to adjust the resource requests based on your available cluster resources.
The script includes simulated training for demonstration; in a production environment, we would organize the dataset into class folders for proper training.
