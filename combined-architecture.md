System Overview
I've designed a comprehensive IoT system for detecting defects in solar panels using thermal imaging, stereo cameras, and environmental sensors. The system leverages edge AI processing with the Axelera Metis M.2 AI accelerator (offering 214 TOPS at 15W power consumption) and a Kubernetes-based infrastructure for scalability and reliability.
Key Components

Hardware Layer:

Thermal cameras for hotspot detection
Stereo cameras for 3D imaging and depth perception
Environmental sensors for temperature, irradiance, and humidity monitoring
Axelera Metis M.2 AI accelerator for edge processing


Software Components:

Thermal Defect Detector: AI-powered analysis of thermal images to identify hotspots, cell cracks, bypass diode failures, etc.
Data Collector: Aggregates and pre-processes sensor data before storage
AI Processor: Runs computer vision models and machine learning algorithms
API Server: Provides RESTful endpoints for system access and integration


Kubernetes Deployment:

Can be deployed on lightweight K3s for edge environments
Supports Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) for cloud deployment
Includes monitoring with Prometheus and visualization with Grafana



Defect Detection Capabilities
The system can detect various types of solar panel defects:

Hotspots (thermal anomalies)
Cell cracks
Bypass diode failures
Delamination
Potential-induced degradation (PID)
Dust accumulation
Moisture ingress

Each defect is classified by type and severity, with specific maintenance recommendations generated based on the analysis.
Implementation Features

Multi-sensor Fusion: Combines data from different sensor types for comprehensive defect detection
Real-time Monitoring: Continuous scanning of panels with alerts for critical issues
Edge Processing: AI inference at the edge reduces bandwidth requirements and latency
Scalable Architecture: Easily scales from small installations to large solar farms
Maintenance Prioritization: Ranks defects by severity to optimize maintenance schedules
Visualization: Graphical dashboards for intuitive monitoring and trend analysis

Bypass Diode Failures: Junction box component failures
Delamination: Separation of panel layers
PID (Potential-Induced Degradation): Voltage stress causing power loss
Dust/Soiling: Accumulation of dirt and debris
Moisture Ingress: Water penetration into panels

Getting Started
Prerequisites

Kubernetes cluster (K3s or AKS)
Docker and Docker Compose (for local development)
Git

Installation
Kubernetes Deployment

Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/solar-panel-defect-detection.git
cd solar-panel-defect-detection
```

Apply kubernetes manifests

```
# For K3s deployment
./k3s-setup/install-k3s-master.sh
kubectl apply -f manifests/namespace.yaml
kubectl apply -f manifests/storage/
kubectl apply -f manifests/datacollector-processor/
kubectl apply -f manifests/aiprocessor/
kubectl apply -f manifests/supportingservice/
kubectl apply -f manifests/sensor/
```

Local Development with Docker Compose

Start the services:

```
docker-compose up -d
```

Access the API

```
curl http://localhost:8000/api/health
```

View the Grafana dashboard:

```
http://localhost:3000 (admin/admin)
```
Usage
API Endpoints
The system exposes several RESTful API endpoints:

/api/health: Health check endpoint
/api/panel/{panel_id}/defects: Get defects for a specific panel
/api/panel/{panel_id}/analyze: Trigger analysis for a specific panel
/api/panels/status: Get status of all panels
/api/defects/recent: Get recent defects
/api/defects/summary: Get a summary of defect types and counts

Example:

```
# Get defects for a specific panel
curl http://localhost:8000/api/panel/panel-001/defects

# Trigger analysis for a panel
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/panel/panel-001/analyze
```

Monitoring Dashboards
The system includes pre-configured Grafana dashboards for:

Solar panel temperature monitoring
Defect distribution and trends
System performance metrics

Access the dashboards at http://localhost:3000 after deployment.
Development
Testing with the Sensor Simulator
The sensor simulator can be used to generate test data:

```
python sensor_simulator.py --panels 20 --defect-prob 0.2
```

Parameters:

--url: Data collector URL (default: http://data-collector-service:8080/sensor-data)
--interval: Interval between readings in seconds (default: 5)
--panels: Number of panels to simulate (default: 10)
--defect-prob: Probability of generating a defect (default: 0.1)

Building Custom Models
To train custom models for thermal defect detection:

Gather labeled thermal images of solar panels with known defects
Place them in the training/data directory, organized by defect type

Run the training script:
```
python training/train_thermal_model.py
```

Deploy the model:

```
kubectl apply -f manifests/supportingservice/train_model_deployment.yaml
```
